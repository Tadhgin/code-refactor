GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
